Welcome to my bamazon application where you can view our products and purchase what you like as long as it is in stock!

Requirements:

mySQL, Node, gitbash terminal, NPM install of mysql and inquirer.

to get started open the bamazonCustomer.js file in gitbash terminal with node. (node bamazonCustomer.js)
once started you will see your options.

You may also run the bamazonManager.js file to see the admin side of our application.

I have included screenshots to show the application in use:
